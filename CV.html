                <H2>Profile</H2>
                <p>I am currently dedicated to repairing computer equipment and cell phones. In 2022, I started my
                    journey in web development, and since then, I have been actively preparing myself through various
                    study methods, such as videos, websites, applications, and online classes. I enjoy solving problems
                    for individuals as well as projects.

                    Throughout my career, I have acquired knowledge in drawing, design, and electronics. I have also
                    developed an interest in psychology and philosophy, and I enjoy exploring these subjects through
                    self-learning.

                    My long-term goal is to establish my own startup, where I can utilize my skills in web development,
                    equipment repair, and design, along with my passion for solving problems and creating innovative
                    solutions.</p>

            <h2>Experience:</h2>
            <p>I have created multiple mini projects, and from my humble point of view, some of the most relevant ones
                are those that showcase real-life business needs. I will be uploading the most recent projects to my
                portfolio.
